# Test Repository 

This is a repository to test Spring Boot in combination with Kotlin and Kotest

### Motivation
I planned to create a simple small application processing the typical application layers with SpringBoot
and Kotlin / Kotest and convert this to a micronaut app. To have a little bit business logic I chose the
process of borrowing books in a lending library under simplified conditions.

### Result
The combination of SpringBoot and Kotlin / Kotest was not as smooth as expected and a couple of problems had
to be solved - therefore I decided to stop here. 

At least should the result be good enough to have a basis for discussions
regarding code style and possible solutions.
